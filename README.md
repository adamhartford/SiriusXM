# SiriusXM (UNOFFICIAL)
UNOFFICIAL Dedicated SiriusXM Mac Application (SiriusXM subscription required)

[Download Latest Version (1.3)](https://github.com/adamhartford/SiriusXM/releases/download/v1.3/SiriusXM.UNOFFICIAL.1.3.zip 'Download')

## Why?
I do not like keeping audio players open in browser tabs. SiriusXM does not have an official Mac app, so I've created an extremely basic unoffical one.

## Features
* Playback controls via application menu and app icon
* Optional notifications when song changes

## Technical
* Native macOS application written in C# using [Xamarin.Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/mac/)
* Requires [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) and [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
* I personally use [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) instead of Visual Studio for Mac
