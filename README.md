# SiriusXM
UNOFFICIAL Dedicated SiriusXM Mac Application (SiriusXM subscription required)

[Download Latest Version (1.1)](https://github.com/adamhartford/SiriusXM/releases/download/v1.1/SiriusXM.UNOFFICIAL.1.1.zip 'Download')

## Why?
I do not like keeping audio players open in browser tabs. SiriusXM does not have an official Mac app, so I've created an extremely basic unoffical one. I may add additional features like player controls and notifications, but for now this meets my needs.
